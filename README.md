Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure and Anonymous is an experimental network protocol that aims to remove the flaws in other popular anonymous browsing systems such as tor. It will achieve this via a new protocol that will be implemented with a module for Apache, but like any other protocol could be added as a functionally to other software. On the client side it will be implemented either as a new web browser, chrome extension, or branch of an open source web browser. The exact implementation is undecided at this time.
